# COMP30020-Project1
My project 1 from COMP30020 (Declarative Programming), semester 2, 2020 @ The University of Melbourne.

Written in Prolog which we learnt in the first 4 weeks of the course. This was my first exposure to Prolog and my first ever project in it.
It was written and developed on the online platform Grok hence the lack of commits here and a single file being used. 

Specifications are included as a PDF.

My feedback is also included as a PDF. 
- First 3 pages shows my /30 mark and feedback for "quality of code and documentation"
- Page 4 shows the test cases I've passed (passed all) for the hand_value/3 predicate
- Page 5 shows the test cases for select_hand/3 and the 'percentage quality' my code attained (100% for all except 87.5% for test 4)
