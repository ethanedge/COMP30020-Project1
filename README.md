# COMP30020-Project1
My project 1 from COMP30020 (Declarative Programming), semester 2, 2020 @ The University of Melbourne.

Written in Prolog which we learnt in the first 4 weeks of the course. This was my first exposure to Prolog and my first ever project in it.
It was written and developed on the online platform Grok hence the lack of commits here and a single file being used. 

Specifications are included as a PDF.
